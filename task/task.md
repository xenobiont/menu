# Task

Write the code, which works as follows:

1. Clicking on menu item adds a class to the item ('active' by default, but you should have a possibility to easily change it)

2. All other menu points become inactive

3. Use delegation pattern (event bubbling and target property)

4. Disable links using Javascript


## Bonus

Mouse click + Ctrl/Cmd  should activate the menu item, without disabling already activated items (should work like folders selection e.g. in Windows explorer)
